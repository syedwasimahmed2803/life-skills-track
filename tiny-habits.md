# Tiny Habits

### Answer 1
The most interesting story for me was how BJ Fogg used tiny habits to change his own behavior. He started by doing two push-ups after he peed. He then gradually increased the number of push-ups he did until he was doing 50-60 push-ups a day.

### Answer 2
The Tiny Habits method is a way to use the B = MAP formula to make it easier to form new habits
- Shrink the behavior
- Identify an action prompt
- Celebrate your successes


B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
M is Motivation, which is your desire or willingness to do something.
A is Ability, which is your capacity to do something.
P is Prompt, which is a trigger that reminds you to do something.

### Answer 3
There are a few reasons why celebrating is so important.
- First, it helps to create a positive association with the habit. When you celebrate after doing the habit, you are essentially telling yourself that you did a good job and that you are proud of yourself. This positive association makes it more likely that you will want to do the habit again in the future.
- Second, celebrating helps to increase your motivation. When you feel good about yourself after doing a habit, you are more likely to be motivated to do it again. This is because motivation is often driven by positive emotions.


### Answer 4
The story of James Clear and his writing habit: This story tells how James Clear developed a writing habit that led to him writing over 400 articles and growing his website to over a million visitors per month.

### Answer 5
The book argues that identity is a collection of tiny habits that we perform on a daily basis. These habits, no matter how small, shape who we are and who we become. The book provides a framework for developing new habits and breaking old ones, based on the idea that we can "hack" our own behavior by making small, incremental changes. The book also emphasizes the importance of celebrating our successes, no matter how small, as this helps to build momentum and motivation. 

### Answer 6
The book also provides a number of practical tips for building good habits and breaking bad ones. 
- Don't try to change too much at once. Start with small, manageable changes that you are more likely to stick with.
- Make the cues for your good habits obvious and the cues for your bad habits invisible.
- Make your good habits attractive by pairing them with something you enjoy.
- Make your good habits easy to do by reducing the friction involved.
- Make your good habits immediately satisfying by rewarding yourself for doing them.

### Answer 7
The book suggests that to make a habit harder to do, you should:
- Remove the things that trigger the habit
- Make the habit less enjoyable 
- Make it harder to do the habit
- Remove the things that make the habit rewarding
