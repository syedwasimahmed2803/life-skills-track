# Tiny Habits

### Answer 1
The most interesting story for me was how BJ Fogg used tiny habits to change his own behavior. He started by doing two push-ups after he peed. He then gradually increased the number of push-ups he did until he was doing 50-60 push-ups a day.

### Answer 2
The Tiny Habits method is a way to use the B = MAP formula to make it easier to form new habits
- Shrink the behavior
- Identify an action prompt
- Celebrate your successes
B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
M is Motivation, which is your desire or willingness to do something.
A is Ability, which is your capacity to do something.
P is Prompt, which is a trigger that reminds you to do something.
