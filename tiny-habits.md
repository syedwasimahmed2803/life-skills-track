# Tiny Habits

### Answer 1
The most interesting story for me was how BJ Fogg used tiny habits to change his own behavior. He started by doing two push-ups after he peed. He then gradually increased the number of push-ups he did until he was doing 50-60 push-ups a day.

### Answer 2
The Tiny Habits method is a way to use the B = MAP formula to make it easier to form new habits
- Shrink the behavior
- Identify an action prompt
- Celebrate your successes


B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.
M is Motivation, which is your desire or willingness to do something.
A is Ability, which is your capacity to do something.
P is Prompt, which is a trigger that reminds you to do something.

### Answer 3
There are a few reasons why celebrating is so important. First, it helps to create a positive association with the habit. When you celebrate after doing the habit, you are essentially telling yourself that you did a good job and that you are proud of yourself. This positive association makes it more likely that you will want to do the habit again in the future.
Second, celebrating helps to increase your motivation. When you feel good about yourself after doing a habit, you are more likely to be motivated to do it again. This is because motivation is often driven by positive emotions.
