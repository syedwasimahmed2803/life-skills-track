# Apache Kafka

## What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform designed for constructing real-time data pipelines and streaming applications at a massive scale.
Originally developed at LinkedIn, Kafka addresses the challenge of ingesting high volumes of event data with low latency. 
It operates as a cluster that can extend across multiple servers or data centers. 
The records produced are replicated and partitioned to allow a large number of users to use the application simultaneously without perceptible performance lag.

## Features of Apache Kafka:
- Fast
- Highly accurate
- Maintains the order of occurrence
- Fault-tolerant

## Use Cases of Apache Kafka:
- Decoupling
- Messaging
- Location Tracking
- Data Gathering

## APIs Kafka is built on:
- Producer API
- Consumer API
- Streams API
- Connector API

## Conclusion
In microservices Architecture Apache services acts as a real-time databus that allows different services to talk to each other.
Kafka is quite complicated and has a steep learning curve. It requires some expertise for setup, scaling and maintenance which might not be suitable for smaller startups.
