# Apache Kafka

## What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming platform designed for constructing real-time data pipelines and streaming applications at a massive scale.
Originally developed at LinkedIn, Kafka addresses the challenge of ingesting high volumes of event data with low latency. 
It operates as a cluster that can extend across multiple servers or data centers. 
The records produced are replicated and partitioned to allow a large number of users to use the application simultaneously without perceptible performance lag.
