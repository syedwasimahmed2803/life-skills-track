### Sexual Harassment

# Sexual harassment encompasses a range of unwelcome behaviors of a sexual nature that create a hostile or intimidating environment. Examples of behaviors that can constitute sexual harassment include:

- Any unwanted sexual advances, comments, or requests for sexual favors.
- Using authority or power to coerce someone into unwanted sexual activities.
- Making inappropriate comments, jokes, or innuendos of a sexual nature.
- Touching, groping, or any physical contact of a sexual nature without consent.


# If I face or witness any incident of such behavior, I would:

1. Directly communicate that the behavior is unwelcome and ask the person to stop.
2. Keep a record of the incident, including dates, times, locations, and any people who may have witnessed the behavior.
3. Report the incident to the appropriate authorities, such as HR, supervisors, or administrators.
